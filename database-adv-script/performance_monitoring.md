Here’s a comprehensive approach to the objective, including how to monitor, analyze, refine, and report on query performance improvements:

---

### **Objective: Continuously Monitor and Refine Database Performance**

---

### **Step 1: Monitor Query Performance**

#### 1.1 Use `SHOW PROFILE` or `EXPLAIN ANALYZE`
Start by identifying frequently used queries. Use tools like `SHOW PROFILE` or `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` to understand how these queries are executed and to identify potential bottlenecks.

Example using `SHOW PROFILE`:
```sql
SET profiling = 1;

-- Execute the query to monitor
SELECT * FROM Booking WHERE start_date BETWEEN '2023-01-01' AND '2023-12-31';

-- View the profiling results
SHOW PROFILE FOR QUERY 1;
```

Example using `EXPLAIN ANALYZE`:
```sql
EXPLAIN ANALYZE SELECT * 
FROM Booking 
WHERE start_date BETWEEN '2023-01-01' AND '2023-12-31';
```

#### 1.2 Analyze the Output
Focus on the following metrics:
- **Query execution time**: Look for slow queries.
- **Rows examined**: Identify if unnecessary rows are being scanned.
- **Cost estimate**: High costs may indicate inefficient operations.

---

### **Step 2: Identify Bottlenecks**

Common bottlenecks include:
- **Full Table Scans**: Occur when no appropriate indexes are used.
- **High Rows Examined**: Indicates inefficient filtering or join conditions.
- **Sorting or Temporary Tables**: Suggests inefficient query structure.

Example:
If a query like:
```sql
SELECT * FROM Booking WHERE status = 'confirmed';
```
shows a full table scan, adding an index on the `status` column can help.

---

### **Step 3: Suggest and Implement Changes**

Based on the analysis, make the following schema adjustments:

#### 3.1 Create Indexes
- Identify frequently filtered or joined columns and add indexes.
```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_booking_status ON Booking (status);
CREATE INDEX idx_booking_start_date ON Booking (start_date);
```

#### 3.2 Optimize Query Logic
- Refactor queries to reduce unnecessary joins or operations.
Example:
Change:
```sql
SELECT * FROM User 
JOIN Booking ON User.user_id = Booking.user_id
WHERE User.email LIKE '%gmail%';
```
To:
```sql
SELECT User.user_id, User.first_name, Booking.booking_id
FROM User 
JOIN Booking ON User.user_id = Booking.user_id
WHERE User.email LIKE '%gmail%';
```
This reduces the number of columns retrieved, improving performance.

#### 3.3 Partitioning
For large tables, implement partitioning to optimize range queries.

#### 3.4 Denormalization
For heavily joined queries, consider storing pre-joined data in a new table for faster lookups.

---

### **Step 4: Monitor and Compare Improvements**

Test the same queries after implementing changes using `SHOW PROFILE` or `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` and compare results. Key metrics to evaluate:
- Reduced **execution time**.
- Lower **rows examined**.
- Improved query **cost** in the execution plan.

---

### **Step 5: Report the Improvements**

Here’s a sample report:

---

#### **Report: Database Performance Optimization**

**Objective:**
To monitor and optimize the performance of frequently used queries by analyzing execution plans and making schema adjustments.

**Monitoring:**
- The query `SELECT * FROM Booking WHERE start_date BETWEEN '2023-01-01' AND '2023-12-31';` was analyzed using `SHOW PROFILE` and `EXPLAIN ANALYZE`.
- Observed bottlenecks:
  - Full table scan.
  - High rows examined: 100,000 rows for a 10,000-row result.

**Changes Implemented:**
1. **Indexing:**
   - Added indexes on `start_date` and `status` columns to optimize filtering:
     ```sql
     CREATE INDEX idx_booking_start_date ON Booking (start_date);
     CREATE INDEX idx_booking_status ON Booking (status);
     ```

2. **Query Optimization:**
   - Reduced unnecessary column retrieval to only required fields.

3. **Partitioning:**
   - Partitioned the `Booking` table by year using `start_date` to improve range queries:
     ```sql
     CREATE TABLE Booking (
         booking_id INT,
         user_id INT,
         start_date DATE
     )
     PARTITION BY RANGE (YEAR(start_date)) (
         PARTITION p2022 VALUES LESS THAN (2023),
         PARTITION p2023 VALUES LESS THAN (2024)
     );
     ```

**Results:**
- **Before Optimization:**
  - Execution time: 1.2 seconds.
  - Rows examined: 100,000.
  - Cost: High (full table scan).
- **After Optimization:**
  - Execution time: 0.3 seconds.
  - Rows examined: 10,000 (only relevant partition).
  - Cost: Significantly lower (partition and index scan).

**Conclusion:**
The performance optimization reduced query execution time by over 75%, with fewer rows examined and lower I/O costs. Continuous monitoring and refinement using indexing, partitioning, and query optimization strategies are recommended for sustained performance improvements.
