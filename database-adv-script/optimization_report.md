To answer your questions, I will guide you through the steps of writing an initial query, analyzing its performance, and refactoring it for better performance.

### Step 1: Write the Initial Query
Here is an example of an initial query that retrieves all bookings along with the user details, property details, and payment details from three tables: `Booking`, `User`, `Property`, and `Payment`.

```sql
-- Initial query to fetch all booking details with related user, property, and payment information.
SELECT 
    b.booking_id,
    b.user_id,
    b.property_id,
    b.booking_date,
    b.status AS booking_status,
    u.user_id,
    u.first_name,
    u.last_name,
    u.email,
    p.property_id,
    p.name AS property_name,
    p.location,
    p.price_per_night,
    pay.payment_id,
    pay.payment_amount,
    pay.payment_date
FROM 
    Booking b
JOIN 
    User u ON b.user_id = u.user_id
JOIN 
    Property p ON b.property_id = p.property_id
JOIN 
    Payment pay ON b.booking_id = pay.booking_id;
```

### Step 2: Analyze the Query’s Performance Using `EXPLAIN`
Now, we need to analyze the performance of this query by using `EXPLAIN` in MySQL. This will give us insight into how MySQL plans to execute the query, including which indexes it uses, whether it's doing full table scans, and how many rows it expects to examine.

```sql
EXPLAIN SELECT 
    b.booking_id,
    b.user_id,
    b.property_id,
    b.booking_date,
    b.status AS booking_status,
    u.user_id,
    u.first_name,
    u.last_name,
    u.email,
    p.property_id,
    p.name AS property_name,
    p.location,
    p.price_per_night,
    pay.payment_id,
    pay.payment_amount,
    pay.payment_date
FROM 
    Booking b
JOIN 
    User u ON b.user_id = u.user_id
JOIN 
    Property p ON b.property_id = p.property_id
JOIN 
    Payment pay ON b.booking_id = pay.booking_id;
```

#### Explanation of `EXPLAIN` Output
- **access_type**: Describes how the query will access the data (e.g., `ALL`, `range`, `ref`, etc.).
- **rows_examined_per_scan**: The number of rows MySQL expects to scan in each table.
- **key**: The index MySQL will use, if applicable.
- **filtered**: The percentage of rows filtered by the query condition.
- **cost_info**: The estimated cost for executing the query.

From the output of the `EXPLAIN` command, you may find areas where there are inefficiencies, such as:
- Full table scans (`access_type: ALL`) instead of using indexes.
- Joins between large tables that can be optimized.
- Missing or poorly designed indexes.

### Step 3: Refactor the Query to Improve Performance

#### Potential Improvements
1. **Use Indexes**: Ensure that appropriate indexes exist on the `user_id`, `property_id`, and `booking_id` columns for fast lookups. If these indexes don’t exist, create them.
   
2. **Reduce Unnecessary Joins**: If not all the data is required in the result set, you can remove unnecessary columns or joins.

3. **Use `EXPLAIN ANALYZE`**: After refactoring, use `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` to get real execution times and see how the query performs with the changes.

4. **Limit the Data Retrieved**: If you’re only interested in a subset of the data (e.g., for a particular date range or status), add a `WHERE` clause to reduce the result set and speed up execution.

5. **Optimize Join Order**: Reordering the joins in the query can sometimes lead to performance improvements. For example, joining smaller tables first or more selective tables first might reduce the total number of rows being processed.

#### Refactored Query Example

Let's assume we've added the necessary indexes on `user_id`, `property_id`, and `booking_id`, and we’ve added a `WHERE` clause to limit the results to bookings that occurred in the last month:

```sql
-- Refactored query to fetch all booking details with related user, property, and payment information
-- and with optimizations for performance.
SELECT 
    b.booking_id,
    u.first_name,
    u.last_name,
    u.email,
    p.name AS property_name,
    p.location,
    p.price_per_night,
    pay.payment_amount,
    pay.payment_date
FROM 
    Booking b
JOIN 
    User u ON b.user_id = u.user_id
JOIN 
    Property p ON b.property_id = p.property_id
JOIN 
    Payment pay ON b.booking_id = pay.booking_id
WHERE
    b.booking_date >= CURDATE() - INTERVAL 1 MONTH;
```

#### Explanation of Changes
1. **Indexed Columns**: Ensure indexes are created on `user_id` (in `User` table), `property_id` (in `Property` table), and `booking_id` (in both `Booking` and `Payment` tables).
   
   Example index creation:

   ```sql
   CREATE INDEX idx_user_id ON User(user_id);
   CREATE INDEX idx_property_id ON Property(property_id);
   CREATE INDEX idx_booking_id ON Booking(booking_id);
   CREATE INDEX idx_payment_booking_id ON Payment(booking_id);
   ```

2. **Filtered Results**: We added a `WHERE` clause to retrieve only bookings from the last month, which can significantly reduce the number of rows being processed.

3. **Removed Unnecessary Columns**: If you're only interested in essential information (e.g., user name, property name, payment), you can limit the columns selected to reduce the data load.

4. **Using `EXPLAIN ANALYZE`**: Once you have refactored the query, run `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` on it to check the execution plan and verify the performance improvements.

### Step 4: Run `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` After Refactoring
After applying the optimizations, you can check the performance improvements by running `EXPLAIN ANALYZE`:

```sql
EXPLAIN ANALYZE SELECT 
    b.booking_id,
    u.first_name,
    u.last_name,
    u.email,
    p.name AS property_name,
    p.location,
    p.price_per_night,
    pay.payment_amount,
    pay.payment_date
FROM 
    Booking b
JOIN 
    User u ON b.user_id = u.user_id
JOIN 
    Property p ON b.property_id = p.property_id
JOIN 
    Payment pay ON b.booking_id = pay.booking_id
WHERE
    b.booking_date >= CURDATE() - INTERVAL 1 MONTH;
```

#### What to Look For in `EXPLAIN ANALYZE`:
- **Reduced `rows_examined_per_scan`**: A significant decrease in the number of rows being scanned is a good indicator of improved performance.
- **Use of Indexes**: Ensure that MySQL is using indexes to optimize lookups (`key` field should not be `NULL`).
- **Improved Execution Time**: Check the **actual time** it takes to execute the query and compare it to the original execution time.

### Conclusion
By analyzing and refactoring the query with optimizations such as using indexes, reducing unnecessary joins, and filtering the data with a `WHERE` clause, you can significantly improve the performance of the query. Additionally, using `EXPLAIN` and `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` allows you to visualize the execution plan and verify improvements.
